## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is the game world going to be procedurally animated or hand-crafted?
The core cities and areas are intended to be hand-crafted. The wilderness or open world areas are currently being considered to be procedurally generated.

### What game engine does the game use?
The developers currently use Unreal Engine 4 as a game engine, however they did mention that if/when they want to switch to UE5 when it is more mature, it should be pretty easy/take very little effort.

### How is player networking and persistence handled? (Server sharding, etc.)
OWS - Open World Server is currently used as a networking and persistence back-end for the game.

### Is there player housing? Is it permanent?
Instanced player housing that is not deleted.\
Wilderness buildings or builds in the public areas can be destroyed by events and will probably be a lot more temporary.

### Are there multiple classes in game?
No, the game is classless and completely based on skills your character can acquire, perhaps something akin to Runescape.

### How will combat work?
It was mentioned that the combat may be something akin to having multiple attack types per weapon, again somewhat akin of Runescape. However, weapons will be crafted in a modular way (See plenty of Callum's youtube videos) which will affect how combat will flow.

Because of the modular smithing system, they are currently looking towards making this into action combat.

### Are there multiple races in the game?
The players (tentatively called _Citizens_ at the moment), are mostly humanoid beings. However, the world they live on can morph them, introducing additional character customisation features, ranging from simple new skins, model/ear features, scales, elves, dragon people, up to werewolves and other still humanoid but more animalistic morphs. Races will be mostly a role-playing features and may form cliques.

### Will there be flying in the game?
No, most likely not, because it is hard to indicate player direction when there is free flying available. However, gliding may be introduced at some point.

### What tools are being used to develop the game?
The developers are proving that you can start the development of a game / vertical slice of a game, using solely free tools, without any additional funding.

Because of this, they are focusing on various freely available tools:

* UE4
* Blender
* GIMP
* Krita
* OWS
* ...
